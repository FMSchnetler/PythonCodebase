# Largest palindrome product

# Problem 4

# A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.

# Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

    palindrome = str(n)
    if palindrome == palindrome[::-1]:
        return True

# Correct answer is 906609
